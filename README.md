# hslu-dc-bot
A simple discord bot for our School-Channel on discord.

Creating new Projects (new category + channels for communication) and setting permissions, so not everybody gets spammed.
Possibility to add more channels inside the category, as well as adding permissions to the created category for other users.

For visibility purposes, projects can not be named the same like others (channels can).
Also Commands are only allowed in a specific channel

Examples:
Create Project
$newProject PROJECTNAME
$newProject "PROJECT NAME WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERS"
